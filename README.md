The servo is a TowerPro MG995 purchased on AliExpress.

There are two settings in the diameter at the top, at first I used a black waste pipe ( 1 1/2" ) that goes into the flange to load the coins in bulk.  I found these inexpensive lamp guards  [Tap Plastics](https://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/plastic_rods_tubes_shapes/lamp_guards/275) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/48-Clear-Guard-American-4T8TG/dp/B01M03QJ63/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1508767848&sr=8-4&keywords=lamp+guards+clear) that are clear, and cut them in half with an exacto knife. The chocolate coins I used were from [CostPlus World Market](https://www.worldmarket.com/product/steenland-mesh-bag-of-bank-vault-coins.do?sortby=ourPicks&from=Search) but for Halloween I bought them in bulk from [ohnuts](https://www.ohnuts.com/buy.cfm/bulk-chocolate/coins/gold-1-lb-bag)

This dispenser was used in our [slot machine](https://github.com/alanswx/boxes), either based on a [pi and tablet](https://github.com/alanswx/FlaskSlotMachine)  or [pi with it's own display](https://github.com/alanswx/kivySlots). The prototype was cut with a jigsaw, the final version was laser cut using the boxes library.
