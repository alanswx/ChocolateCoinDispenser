The servo is a TowerPro MG995 purchased on AliExpress.

A black waste pipe 1 1/2" goes into the top to load the coins in bulk. I think it would be better to use a clear pipe. I need to look for something suitable.  The chocolate coins I used were from CostPlus World Market https://www.worldmarket.com/product/steenland-mesh-bag-of-bank-vault-coins.do?sortby=ourPicks&from=Search
